# Data Science

This section features my work as a Data Scientist with the Center for Municipal Finance where I built sustainable tools, wrangled data, and interactive websites for public use.

- [An example webpage from a series of 3000 webpages analyzing property taxes nationwide](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/propertytaxdata.uchicago.edu/nationwide_reports/web/Hennepin%20County_Minnesota.html) using geospatial and statistical techniques in R
- [An R package for property tax analysis](/cmfproperty)
- [A nationwide analysis of 40M property sales](example_nationwide.html) using interactive maps (mapbox) and menus (Select2)
