<h1>A Nationwide Study of Property Assessments</h1>
<p>In order to compare the performance of one community against any other, the Center has utilized a single commercially-available data set, provided by <a href="http://corelogic.com">CoreLogic</a>. CoreLogic is a commercial firm which collects local data records from both public and private entities to provide a uniform picture into the market values, assessed values, and a range of descriptive information for more than 99% of all residential properties in America... <em>almost 40 million sales in total</em>. For an evaluation of assessments nationwide, <a href="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/propertytaxdata.uchicago.edu/core_logic_nationwide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here</a> to review our Nationwide Report.</p>

<p>To see how property assessments in your community compare with other communities throughout the nation, please select your major metro region from the drop down list below. Or you can zoom into your community using the map below for a visual comparison of your city, county, or state. </p>

<p>Note that for some counties (shaded black or clear above) sales were either unavailable or too infrequent for analysis.</p>

<h2>What does this map show?</h2>

<p>In all fifty states, lower-value homes were on average assessed at higher rates than higher-value homes.</p>

<p>As shown in our map, a value of 1 means that low and high value homes were on average assessed at the same rate. Values below 1 (shaded in reds and yellows) are <strong>regressive</strong> areas where lower value homes are assessed at higher rates than high value homes. For example, in the least equitable state (Alabama), low value homes are assessed at over twice the rate of high value homes on average. Property assessments are roughly converted into property taxes---so in Alabama these lower value homes likely pay a tax rate much higher that of high value homes.</p>
