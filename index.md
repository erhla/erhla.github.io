# Hello!

Welcome to my site. Here you can find information on my [resume](resume.html), and [portfolio](portfolio.html).

## About me

*Code is policy.* In government, the choices we make when building systems or analyzing data are policy choices. I work at the intersection of Data Science & Government telling stories which make a difference and bring positive change. I received a MS in Computational Analysis & Public Policy from the University of Chicago in 2020.

I am a [data](example_nationwide.html) [scientist](/cmfproperty), [award-winning historian](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/indimagahist.115.2.01), [policymaker](https://gitlab.com/users/erhlango/activity), and [educator](https://chicago2020.satrdays.org/). Check out my portfolio [here](portfolio.html).
