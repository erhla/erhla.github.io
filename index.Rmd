## About Me

*Code is policy.* In government, the choices we make when building systems and analyzing data are policy choices. I work at the intersection of Data Science & Government telling stories which make a difference and bring positive change. I received a MS in Computational Analysis & Public Policy from the University of Chicago in 2020. I have worked at the city, county, state, and federal levels of government.

I am a [data](example_nationwide.html) [scientist](/cmfproperty), [award-winning historian](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/indimagahist.115.2.01), [policymaker](https://gitlab.com/users/erhlango/activity), and [educator](https://chicago2020.satrdays.org/). I currently work at the [Illinois Department of Central Management Services](https://www2.illinois.gov/cms/Pages/default.aspx) and on a [civic tech tool](https://app.propertytaxproject.com/detroit) to automatically file [property tax appeals for low-income homeowners](https://illegalforeclosures.org/).
